# Discordnim

A Discord library for Nim, with a sweet DSL to abstract the details away.

## Features

* Full DSL for simplified command-based bot creation
* Autogenerated command help
* No runtime overhead! See macro definition

Websockets from [niv/websocket.nim](https://github.com/niv/websocket.nim)

# Installing

This assumes that you have your Nim environment (including [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)) already set up, and that your Nim version is `1.0.4` or greater.
You can check your version with `nim --version`

```
nim -v
Nim Compiler Version 1.1.1 [Linux: amd64]
Compiled at 2020-01-08
Copyright (c) 2006-2019 by Andreas Rumpf

active boot switches: -d:release
```

`nimble install https://github.com/broad-well/discordnim`

# Usage

There are some examples in the `examples` folder.

Use the DSL to define commands:

```nim
import discordnim

# the shard is assigned to a variable "bot", and the token ("Bot <token>") is read from a local file
discordBot bot, readFile("secretToken"):
  commands "^":
    # will respond to "^test <args>"; assign CommandInvocation to "message"
    command "test", message:
      """ A cool command. """
      # Triple quoted string as the first statement in command body means command documentation (shown for "^help")
      message.reply("hello world!")
      message.react("üòé")

  # top-level "command" is supported, too (no prefix)
  command "*test2*", message:
    message.react("ü§ê")

  # run before starting shard session (variable "bot" is available)
  setup:
    echo "the gateway is " & bot.gateway
```

Initialising a `Shard`:

```nim
when isMainModule:
    import asyncdispatch, discordnim, ospaths

    proc messageCreate(s: Shard, m: MessageCreate) =
        if s.cache.me.id == m.author.id: return
        if m.content == "ping":
            asyncCheck s.channelMessageSend(m.channel_id, "pong")

    let d = newShard("Bot " & getEnv("token")) // get token in environment variables

    proc endSession() {.noconv.} =
        waitFor d.disconnect()

    setControlCHook(endSession)
    d.compress = true
    let removeProc = d.addHandler(EventType.message_create, messageCreate)
    waitFor d.startSession()
    removeProc()
```

All programs have to be compiled with the `-d:ssl` flag.

Example :

```
nimble build -d:ssl
```
OR
```
nim compile -d:ssl --run yourfile.nim
```

When compression is enabled you need a `zlib1.dll` present. Somewhere. I don't know where it should be placed.
